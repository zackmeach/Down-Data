Detailed feedback for recreating an OOTP‑style interface for NFL data
===================================================================

This document summarises what is shown in the Out of the Park Baseball 26
screenshots you provided and suggests how to recreate an equivalent user
interface for real‑life NFL players using PySide/PyQt.  The focus is on
simplicity, modularity and using off‑the‑shelf widgets so that a novice
developer can iterate quickly, while still leaving room for future
expansion.  Wherever possible, the notes recommend avoiding large local
data downloads by querying data on demand via `nflreadpy` and the
`Player` object in your repository.

General layout principles
------------------------

* **Top‑level navigation** –  OOTP uses a narrow bar at the top with the
  league logo, a dropdown to switch between league modules (offseason
  centre, players, free agents, waiver wire, etc.) and a prominent
  “Continue” button.  In PyQt you can recreate this using a
  `QToolBar` or `QTabBar` placed inside a `QMainWindow`.  A
  `QAction` with an icon can represent each section (e.g. “Players”,
  “Teams”, “Draft”, “Season schedule”).  The “Continue” button is a
  standard `QPushButton` anchored to the right.
* **Dark theme** –  The screenshots show a dark background with light
  text and a saturated accent colour on selected tabs.  You can apply
  a similar look very quickly by using the `qdarktheme` package.  For
  example, calling `qdarktheme.setup_theme()` applies a flat dark
  palette automaticallyhttps://pyqtdarktheme.readthedocs.io/en/stable/how_to_use.html#:~:text=You%20can%20customize%20theme%20color.  If you want to adjust the
  accent colour (the bright blue used for selected tabs), pass
  `custom_colors={"primary": "#007ACC"}` to `setup_theme`https://pyqtdarktheme.readthedocs.io/en/stable/how_to_use.html#:~:text=You%20can%20customize%20theme%20color.  This
  produces a professional dark UI without writing your own stylesheets.
* **Consistent margins and spacing** –  Notice that OOTP aligns all
  fields neatly.  Use `QVBoxLayout` and `QHBoxLayout` with uniform
  spacing (4–8 px) to avoid clutter.  Group related controls inside
  `QGroupBox` widgets with titles such as “Personal details” or
  “Filters”.
* **Terminology** –  Throughout this document the following terms are
  used for UI elements:
  
  | Term               | Meaning in the UI                                                |
  |--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
  | navigation bar     | the top bar containing high‑level module buttons                |
  | filter panel       | the left‑hand column where search criteria are defined          |
  | result table       | the central area where matching players or stats are listed     |
  | side panel         | the left column on a player page showing personal details       |
  | tab bar            | the row of labels (e.g. “Summary”, “Contract”) used to switch   |
  |                    | between subpages                                               |
  | stats table        | a `QTableView` or `QTableWidget` presenting numerical data      |
  | rating bar         | a custom widget resembling a horizontal progress bar for skills |

Recreating the “Find a Player” page
-----------------------------------

The first screenshot shows the **Find a Player** screen, which lets you
filter MLB players by age, salary, awards, ratings and statistics.
Adapting this for NFL players requires two pieces: a flexible filter
panel and a results list.

### Filter panel

* **Use Qt widgets that match the data type:**  Age ranges and service
  time can be represented with two `QSpinBox` widgets for minimum and
  maximum values.  Position checkboxes (e.g. QB, RB, WR, TE, OL, DL,
  LB, DB, K) can be grouped in a `QGroupBox` with a `QGridLayout`.
  Drop‑downs such as “Has won award” or “Team” map nicely to
  `QComboBox`.  Boolean options (“Only free agents”) become
  `QCheckBox` widgets.
* **Ratings sliders:**  OOTP lets the user set minimum and maximum values
  for attributes like “Stamina” or “Stuff”.  In PyQt you can use
  `QSlider` or `QSpinBox` pairs, or a custom composite widget where a
  label and two spin boxes are arranged horizontally.  For example:
  
  ```python
  stamina_min = QSpinBox(); stamina_min.setRange(0, 99)
  stamina_max = QSpinBox(); stamina_max.setRange(0, 99)
  layout.addRow("Stamina", create_range_widget(stamina_min, stamina_max))
  ```
* **Reset and search buttons:**  Place two `QPushButton` widgets at
  the bottom of the filter panel.  Connecting the “Reset filters”
  button to a slot that resets each widget to its default value makes
  testing easier.
* **Layout:**  Use `QFormLayout` for the filter panel so labels and
  fields are aligned.  Surround the entire panel with a `QScrollArea`
  to support many criteria without expanding the window.

### Results table

* Use a `QTableView` backed by a `QAbstractTableModel` to display
  matching players.  The model can expose columns such as “Name”,
  “Team”, “Position”, “Age”, “Seasons played” and key stats like
  career passing yards or rushing touchdowns.  When the user selects
  a player in the table, emit a signal to display their profile in
  the main view.
* Because player searches may involve network calls (e.g. calling
  `Player(name).info()` in `nflreadpy`), run the search inside a
  worker thread.  Qt’s `QThreadPool` with `QRunnable` is useful here
  so the UI remains responsive.  Update the model once the thread
  finishes.

### Data access pattern

Your `Player` class already caches nflverse identifiers and can fetch
stats on demand.  To minimise local storage:

1. Use `PlayerFinder` to resolve ambiguous names.  When the user
   enters a partial name or applies filters, call `Player` with the
   appropriate filters (team, position, draft year) and return a small
   set of candidate players.  Avoid loading stats until the user
   opens a specific profile.
2. When a player is selected, instantiate a `Player` object and cache
   it.  The object stores only a few identifiers and biographical
   fields in memory.  Use the provided methods (`fetch_stats()`,
   `get_master_stats_table()`, `fetch_nextgen_stats()`) to retrieve
   per‑season or per‑week data on demand.  Since nflverse limits
   pre‑1999 weekly stats, you should validate the requested seasons and
   provide user feedback when no data is available as described in the
   project’s READMEhttps://pyqtdarktheme.readthedocs.io/en/stable/how_to_use.html#:~:text=You%20can%20customize%20theme%20color.


Designing the player profile pages
----------------------------------

Once a user selects a player, you can switch the central widget to a
profile view.  OOTP splits the profile into several tabs (Summary,
Contract, Strategy, Development, Scouting, Injury History, BNN Page,
Baseball Cards).  For an NFL application, consider the following
structure:

* **Summary tab:**  Show biographical data on the left in a side panel.
  This includes name, birth date, height, weight, draft details and
  team.  Use `QLabel` widgets in a `QFormLayout` so the values align
  neatly.  Below that, add a “Status” group containing health status
  and rest availability.  On the right, display the player’s current
  attribute ratings using custom rating bars.  A simple implementation
  uses `QProgressBar` with a fixed range (e.g. 0–100) and coloured
  stylesheets for different categories (blue for speed, green for
  catching, red for tackling, etc.).
* **Contract tab:**  Replicate the contract page by showing “Contract
  information” (contract type, years, salary per year) and “Roster
  status information” (expectations, trade availability, service time,
  option years) in separate `QGroupBox` widgets.  Use a
  `QTableWidget` to list the yearly salary schedule.  Provide a button
  to negotiate an extension, which could open a dialog or simply be
  disabled at first.
* **Injury history tab:**  Display a `QTableView` with columns for
  date, description, body part, setbacks, day‑to‑day flag, effect and
  injury duration.  The `Player` class does not supply injury data,
  but you could populate this with publicly available information or
  leave the table blank initially.
* **Stats tabs:**  A set of tabs dedicated to statistics can mirror the
  batting/pitching splits in OOTP.  For NFL this could include
  “Career stats”, “Season splits”, “Game logs”, “Situational
  splits” (e.g. vs. man zone coverage) and “NextGen stats”.  Each
  subtab contains a `QTableView` with a model built from the data
  returned by `get_master_stats_table()` or `fetch_stats()`.
  Provide drop‑down filters above the table: season selector (`QComboBox`),
  opponent filter, home/away filter and date range pickers (`QDateEdit`).
* **History/Accomplishments tab:**  Use two vertical panes: one for
  career milestones and awards, and another for memorable games.  A
  `QListWidget` can list awards with year and description, while a
  `QTreeWidget` might group achievements by season.  For game
  achievements, a simple scrollable text area is sufficient.


Styling notes
-------------

1. **Dark palette with custom accent:**  Use the `qdarktheme` library to
   apply a dark theme to the entire application.  Call
   `qdarktheme.setup_theme()` early in your main function.  To change
   the accent colour, pass a `custom_colors` dictionary, e.g.
   `qdarktheme.setup_theme(custom_colors={"primary": "#00A3E0"})`
  https://pyqtdarktheme.readthedocs.io/en/stable/how_to_use.html#:~:text=You%20can%20customize%20theme%20color.  Use a cool blue or teal similar to the OOTP selected
   tabs.
2. **Sharp corners:**  The original OOTP panels have square
   corners.  Pass `corner_shape="sharp"` to `setup_theme` to avoid
   rounded edgeshttps://pyqtdarktheme.readthedocs.io/en/stable/how_to_use.html#:~:text=You%20can%20also%20change%20border,corner%20shape.
3. **Additional QSS:**  For fine‑tuning, supply your own Qt stylesheet
   via `additional_qss` to change border widths, fonts or spacing
  https://pyqtdarktheme.readthedocs.io/en/stable/how_to_use.html#:~:text=Append%20your%20own%20stylesheets.  For example, you can style the rating bars:
   
   ```css
   QProgressBar {
       border: 1px solid #444;
       border-radius: 0px;
       text-align: right;
       padding-right: 4px;
   }
   QProgressBar::chunk {
       background-color: #2E8B57; /* green for run skills */
   }
   ````
4. **Icons:**  When using `qdarktheme`, standard Qt icons follow the
   theme colours automaticallyhttps://pyqtdarktheme.readthedocs.io/en/stable/how_to_use.html#:~:text=If%20you%20setup%20theme%20with,theme%20when%20theme%20is%20changed.  For more complex icons
   (team logos, player headshots), store small PNGs in a resource file
   and load them into `QLabel` or `QPushButton` icons.
5. **Fonts:**  Use a clean sans‑serif font such as “Segoe UI” or
   “Roboto” with a point size around 9–10 pt for tables and 11–12 pt
   for headings.  Consistent typography enhances readability.


Application architecture suggestions
------------------------------------

* **Main window with stacked pages:**  Implement a `QMainWindow`
  containing a `QStackedWidget`.  Each major section (player finder,
  player profile, team explorer, league year view, etc.) is a child
  QWidget inside the stack.  When the user selects a navigation
  action, change the current index of the stacked widget.
* **Model–view separation:**  Use Qt’s model/view framework.  Define
  subclasses of `QAbstractTableModel` for player lists, stats tables
  and history lists.  This keeps your data separate from the
  presentation and makes it easier to update the views when the
  underlying DataFrame changes.
* **Asynchronous data loading:**  Fetching stats via `nflreadr`
  requires HTTP calls.  Use `QThread` or `concurrent.futures` with
  signals/slots to perform these calls in the background.  Emit a
  signal once data has loaded so the table model can be reset.
* **Caching:**  The `Player` class already caches downloaded DataFrames
  in memory.  Keep a dictionary mapping player IDs to `Player` objects
  in your app so repeated lookups reuse the same instance.
* **Extensibility:**  Start with the “Find a Player” page and a basic
  profile view.  When comfortable, add new tabs such as “Teams” or
  “Schedule” by following the same pattern: design a filter panel,
  build a table model and integrate with the main navigation bar.


Final remarks
-------------

Recreating the entire OOTP interface is an ambitious project, but by
breaking the problem into small, self‑contained widgets you can make
steady progress.  Focus first on the core functionality—searching for
players and displaying basic information—before implementing more
advanced pages.  Leveraging PyQt’s layouts, `qdarktheme` for styling
and `nflreadpy` for data retrieval will allow you to build a polished
application without overwhelming your machine with downloaded data.
