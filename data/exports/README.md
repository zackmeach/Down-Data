# Exports Directory

This directory contains CSV/Excel files generated by the Down-Data Player Explorer.

## Files Generated Here

### `player_master_stats.csv`
Generated by: `main.py` CLI or `Player.get_master_stats_table()`

**Contents**: Comprehensive player stats table with one row per season and 100+ stat categories as columns.

**Columns include**:
- Basic stats (passing, rushing, receiving, defensive)
- Advanced metrics (EPA, fantasy points, air yards, etc.)
- Optional NextGen stats (2016+)
- Season-level aggregations

**Usage**:
```python
from player import Player

player = Player(name="Patrick Mahomes")
master_table = player.get_master_stats_table()
master_table.to_csv('data/exports/player_master_stats.csv', index=False)
```

## File Management

- **These files are temporary** - They get overwritten each time you generate new stats
- **Not committed to git** - Listed in .gitignore
- **Keep final analysis files elsewhere** - If you want to save specific exports, rename them or move to a different location

## Organization Tips

For long-term storage of generated files:
1. Rename with descriptive names: `mahomes_2018_2024_stats.csv`
2. Include date: `diggs_coverage_20241018.csv`
3. Or move to a separate `analysis/` folder outside this project
