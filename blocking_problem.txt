Blocking-Stat Data Gap
======================

Overview
--------
We are building a local, desktop “data explorer” that visualises NFL player information.
The stack is Python + PySide6 for the UI, `nflreadpy` + Polars for data access, and a
collection of locally-cached Parquet files for speed.  The app already shows rich
offensive and defensive season summaries (passing yards, rushing yards, sacks taken,
interceptions, etc.) for every player since 1999, using the nflverse data pipelines
(`load_player_stats`, play-by-play, Next Gen Stats, etc.).

However, we cannot surface blocking metrics (pass-block grades, run-block success,
pressures or sacks allowed by an offensive lineman, etc.) because the data feeds we rely
on do not expose those fields:

1. nflverse weekly/season stats – provide standard counting stats only (pass/rush/receive
   columns plus basic defensive data).  No “pressures allowed”, “pass-block win rate”,
   “run-block grade”, or similar columns exist.
2. nflfastR play-by-play (available through `nflreadpy.load_pbp`) – records the ball
   carrier, targeted receiver, tackler(s) and penalty flags.  Offensive linemen are not
   identified on individual plays except in rare penalty situations (e.g., holding).
   There is no attribution of a sack or pressure to a specific blocker.
3. Next Gen Stats (nflverse `load_nextgen_stats`) – includes tracking-based metrics for
   quarterbacks, receivers and rushers (speed, separation, time-to-throw).  It does not
   publish player-level blocking metrics.

Because of those gaps, even attempting to “infer” blocking results is unreliable:

* Sacks are logged with the defender responsible, but the data does not capture which
  offensive lineman was beaten on the play.
* Pressures, hurries and run-block outcomes are not represented at all in the public
  datasets, so there is nothing to aggregate or approximate.
* Offensive line substitutions and positions (LT, LG, C, etc.) are not enumerated per
  play, so even heuristic approaches (e.g., “assume the left tackle gave up the sack if
  the defender lined up at LOLB”) would be blind guesses.

The industry solutions that *do* track blocking are proprietary:

* **PFF (Pro Football Focus)** – manual charting with pressures allowed, pass-block and
  run-block grades.  Access requires a commercial licence.
* **Sports Info Solutions / TruMedia** – similar charting datasets for the trenches,
  also licensed products.
* **Tempus Ex / Infinite Athlete (Next Gen raw tracking)** – can be used to build
  blocking models, but requires enterprise agreements and substantial processing.

Therefore, with our current data sources we cannot honestly present blocker stats or
grade our offensive linemen.  Any UI components that suggest we can display pressures
allowed, pass-block win rate, or run-block effectiveness would be misleading unless we
onboard an additional, licensed provider.

Summary
-------
* The nflverse data stack (weekly stats, play-by-play, Next Gen) exposes no blocker-
  specific metrics.
* Sack attribution to individual offensive linemen is not available, so inference is not
  reliable.
* To get true blocking data we would need to licence charting/tracking products such as
  PFF, SIS, or Tempus Ex.
* Until we add one of those providers, the app should clearly communicate that blocking
  statistics are unavailable rather than displaying placeholder or fabricated values.
